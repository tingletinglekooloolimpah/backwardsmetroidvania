There are 2 playable games

prototype_of_game - this is my prototype
Controls:
interact with mushrooms - e
jump - space
dash - shift
move left and right - ad
wall climb - hold a or d while holding onto a wall
blue walls aren't climbable

Aim:
Find the three mushrooms in the level. Press e to lose the ability that each mushroom says. Once you lose all three abilites, you win.

Bugs:
It is beatable, but you might be able so softlock 
If you hold a and d and dash it will do a super dash
clicking crashes the game
sometimes double jump doesn't work

hook_test - this was to test a grappling hook as the grappling hook in my game broke it many times
it is super buggy and doesn't work at all as intended, but i thought I would include it to show where i am with it
